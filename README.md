# basic-todo-app
Created with CodeSandbox

This is only a basic Todo App as I have a go through lambda School's class component section on React.
I need to add more functionality to it, like when I toggle todo completed it puts a line through the todo, also need to add submit button for the todos that i add to display on screen.
